**Mario on a mission**

Mario and the princess are trapped in a square grid (N*N), Mario needs to reach the princess with minimum number of steps (shortest paths), while avoiding any obstacles. Mario can move UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT and canâ€™t go outside of the grid.

**First task:**

1. Validate the given inputs 
    * max 1 mario and 1 princess.
    * minimum 1 mario and 1 princess. 
    * grid should form a square matrix.
    * the given integer 'n' should be positive number greater than 1
2. Find the shortest path to reach princess avoiding all the obstacles.
3. If you don't find a shortest path, then return any possible path if it exists.

* Inputs:

    ***n:*** grid size, 
    
        For example 3
  
    ***grid:*** n*n matrix in the form of string. Each row is separated by a comma.
		
		For example: '--m,-x-,-p-'

* Output:
	
	    (ERROR_FLAG, [PATH])
	
	For example,
	
	    (True, []) - if any of the constrains are violated. Here True is the
        (False, []) - if all paths to princess are blocked by obstacles
        (False, ['DOWN', 'DOWN', 'LEFT']) - if we find a shortest path or a possible path to princess
        
* How to use:

    Simply run input.py from app/save_princess package and provide inputs.
    
**Second task**

how to run: 

* goto a directory where main.py is present.
* run set FLASK_APP=main.py if you are on windows other export FLASK_APP=main.py
* flask db upgrade
* Finally, start the flask application by running - flask run
	

I'm exposing 3 Rest API endpoints. 

* First is to find the shortest path. This uses the algorithm writer in task1. 
* Second is to see the request logs for a particular request.
* Third is to see all request logs.

Additionally, I'm using SQLLite DB to store the requests.
 
The clients of these API's can use them in the following manner

* shortest path or Possible path if any

**Third Task**

Task: Create a web application to play the Mario game created in task one.

To make the web application interactive I have used Dash by Plotly and added error messages if the inputs are invalid. 

The user can just goto /dashboard/ to play the game. Let's Start then

***If the User enters a valid input and there are no obstacles on the shortest path. The screen will look something like this***

![Shortest](/app/assets/game_output_shortest.png)

***If the User enters a valid input but there are obstacles on the shortest path. Then the game will find the possible path. The screen will look something like this***

![PossiblePath](/app/assets/game_output_possible_path.png)

***If the User enters a valid input but there are obstacles everywhere. The screen will look something like this.***
 
![LostGame](/app/assets/game_output_lost_game.png)

***If the user enters invalid grid***

![InvalidInputs](/app/assets/game_output_invalid_grid.png)

***If number of mario is more than 1***
